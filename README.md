<h2>Overview of Connect Link</h2>
Connect Link is a job portal web application that is designed to break the gap between recruiters and employees. This platform aims to provide an easy and direct job searching and recruitment process through a friendly interface. Recruiters are able to post job opportunities, manage available jobs, and view candidate resumes. On the other hand, applicants are able to browse through a wide range of job choices from various industries. Hence, Connect Link is built to break the inequality in finding job opportunities.

<h2>Problem Analysis</h2>
Connect Link is built to address United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) 8, which is Decent Work and Economic Growth.
